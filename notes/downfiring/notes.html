        <span class="s1"></span>Downfiring doesn't seem to be a very old idea.
        Hank Murrow is often credited with originating the concept in his Sept
        2001 article in Ceramics Monthly. That is, at least as it pertains to
        oxidation cooling as a way of emulating long anagama coolings and
        achieving iron reds on the surfaces of shinos. According to him, Pamela
        Vandiver investigated the red surfaces he obtained and found that their
        microscopic basis is hematite crystallization on the glaze surface.

            <span class="s1"></span>It can take up to 30 minutes for heat to

                30 minutes for the ambient kiln temperature to penetrate a
                -inch-thick clay wall." (Anderson:2019)

          <li>
            <span class="s1"></span>"In a glaze, most bonds are non-crystalline
            glass, but much of the visual and actual textures in glazes is due
            to crystal growth within or upon the glaze. For every desirable
            crystalline effect there is a particular
            <em>zone of crystallization</em> in the cooling that is most
            favorable for the formation of that crystalline material. Above this
            zone, atomic vibration overpowers molecular bonds and crystals
            remelt as fast as they form. Below this zone, increasing viscosity
            prevents the continuing migration of crystal-forming materials in
            the melt, and therefore prevents further crystal growth. By
            regulating the cooling ramp, we can control crystal development."

          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="s1"></span>"In bringing a midrange or highfire
            glaze-firing to maturity, we do want to fire slow enough to allow
            complete fusion and dispersion of the glaze, but once we have
            accomplished that, the firing can actually be cooled fairly quickly
            for the first few hundred degrees. That happens naturally as soon as
            you shut off the elements or fuel, so don’t artificially accelerate
            cooling." (Pitelka:2019)

          <li>
            <span class="s1"></span>"All glazes, in general, may benefit from a
            hold or soak at peak firing temperature to help heal glaze flaws
            such as pinholes and blisters." (Finkelnburg:2010)

            <span class="s1"></span>"This involves programming the cooling ramp
            on the electric kiln to turn the elements back on at 1900°F and hold
            the kiln through a slow descent over three or four hours to 1700°F,
            maximizing opportunities for desirable crystal growth."

                Step 3 approaches the final temperature more slowly and gives
                the glaze and body time to finalize their interaction with each
                other.<br />
                Step 5: Cooling more slow through the 1025 down to 800 range is
                important if you want multiple phases or crystal (and associated
                matte) effects to develop.

                within the glaze dissipate in this region via the same sort of
                annealing process that occurs in ordinary glass (Pitelka:2001,
                p. 154). But care needs to be taken not to introduce

                <span class="s1"></span>The annealing point is related to the
                softening point, which is related to the melting point -- which
                is in turn related to the flux content of the glaze. Glazes that
                begin to soften at a low temperature due to lead or alkaline
                metal fluxes will also anneal at a lower temperature. Glazes
                with higher alkaline earth content will both soften and anneal
                at a higher temperature. So these temperatures are
                flux-dependent.

            cones. I began to draw them beginning with shutdown, and pulling a
            ring out every 50°F during the cooling. I was amazed to find that no
            color showed until around 1900°F, with strong color coming around
            1800°F. Since my kiln has a built-in Oxyprobe, it was easy to tell
            when it had cooled to 1800–1900°F, relight the kiln, and set it for
            steady state and oxidizing atmosphere." (215)

            cooling. When opened, the kiln was full of blood-red Shinos.
            Ecstatic, I fired again, drawing a test ring every 50F during the

            <span class="s1"></span>"The slower the kiln is cooled, or held at a
            given temperature, the more change can occur in the glaze. But kiln
            cooling times are sufficiently rapid that re-absorption of newly
            formed solids cannot take place. The composition of an already so-
            lidified material is set. The rate of cooling can affect glaze only
            up to complete solidification. For cone 6, 1400oF seems a reasonable
            bottom temperature for slow cooling and 2000oF an equally reasonable
            top temperature.<br />
            <br />
            A short hold just after the top temperature is reached helps to even
            out the temperature in the kiln. A long hold at this point will only
            raise the effective cone of the firing.<br />

            From cone 6 (for me 2160°F) to 1400°F the following intervals were

            <br />
            1. 2000-1800°F – The entire glaze is moulten, possible precipitation
            of crystals as in saturated iron glazes.<br />
            2. 1800-1600°F – In multi-phase glazes, segregation has begun, one
            or more phases may have begun to solidify.<br />
            3. 1600-1400°F – The last phases present have begun to solidify."

            <span class="s1"></span>"The most important zone of desirable
            crystal growth occurs around 1800°F. Much of the popularity of the
            book <em>Mastering Cone Six Glazes</em>, or MC6G, by John
            Hesselberth and Ron Roy rests on their explanation of these
            phenomena and instructions how to encourage beneficial crystal
            growth in order to achieve more-interesting glaze surfaces in
            electric kilns. This involves programming the cooling ramp on the
            electric kiln to turn the elements back on at 1900°F and hold the
            kiln through a slow descent over three or four hours to 1700°F,
            maximizing opportunities for desirable crystal growth. Gas kilns
            generally have far more thermal mass, and thus this is not as much
            of an issue. To encourage crystal growth, at the conclusion of the
            firing, close the damper all the way for the first four to six hours
            of cooling. If you really want to maximize this possibility, monitor
            temperature with a pyrometer, and upon reaching 1900°F, reignite the
            burners and soak the kiln for three or four hours as the temperature
            slowly drops to 1700°F, and then turn the burners off and open the
            damper. [...] When you wish to minimize crystallization, it is
            normal to cool quickly down to around 1500°F. Standard toploader
            electrics cool this fast by themselves and require special
            programming only when we wish to maximize crystal growth."

        <span class="s1"></span>“In the late 1980s came the development of the
        material known as ‘Silceram’, a glass–ceramic with composition in the
        CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 quaternary system [110, 111] and made up of pyroxene
        (diopside) as main crystalline phase formed in the 900–1000 °C
        temperature interval.” (Casasola:2011) (1652-1852°F)

        <span class="s1"></span>“Crystallisation begins at temperatures close to
        900 °C, and in glazes fired above 1000 °C a-cordierite is the only
        crystalline phase, developed directly from the glass without prior
        alpha-cordierite crystallisation.” (Casasola:2011) (1652-1852°F)

        <span class="s1"></span>“For this purpose, they studied three frits with
        compositions (in wt%) 55 SiO2, 21.5 Al2O3, (16.5 - x) MgO, x CaO, 3.8
        TiO2 and 2.9 B2O3 (with x = 6.5, 4.6, and 2.9). After fast firing at
        1100 °C, only the composition with 4.6% of CaO leads to a glass–ceramic
        with cordierite as the only crystalline phase. Moreover, this
        composition was the best at promoting cordierite formation after fast
        firing at 1190 °C. Higher CaO content favoured the formation of
        anorthite, whereas higher MgO content promoted enstatite (MgSiO3) and
        forsterite (Mg2SiO4) crystallisation. However, fast firing at higher
        temperatures (1160 and 1190 °C) gave rise to glass–ceramics composed
        merely of a-cordierite.” (Casasola:2011)<span

        <span class="s1"></span>“Thus, for a specific glaze composition, at high
        temperatures (1160–1190 °C), willemite grows as isolated acicular
        crystals, but as the temperature decreases (1100–1160 °C), the viscosity
        of the melt increases and subsequently, the monocrystals split with
        formation of two- leaf spherulites. At lower temperatures (980–1100 °C),
        the greater viscosity of the melt induces monocrystals to split more
        perfectly, which leads to the formation of rounded spherulites.”
