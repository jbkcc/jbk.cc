        I recently bought a little test kiln, a Cone Art BX119.
        <span class="sidenote">[Picture of kiln]</span>
        This tiny charming octagon is my first kiln, and I'm using it to learn how to fire.
        Which is all to say &ndash; I really don't know what I'm doing yet!
        I did research before the first firing, of course, but of course reading is no substitute for experience.
        Last week I did my first glaze firing and all the glazes I expected to be matte came out shiny.
        I knew from my research that this kiln would cool far faster than the larger kilns at my old community studio.
        But to be honest I wasn't prepared for just how different this small kiln's results would be.

        The idea of slowing down the cooling rate of an electric kiln hasn't been around for a very long time.
        As far as I've been able to gather, the idea is usually attributed to Hank Murrow.
        Mel Jacobson did a lot to popularize the idea.
        Carol Marians has done as well.
        The idea spread to the popular awareness and has been described more recently.
        </p>
        <p>
        A number of effects are associated with slow cooling, downfiring, and controlled cooling.
        <ul>
          <li>The development of matte surfaces in flux-saturated glazes.</li>
          <li>The development of iron red color on the surface of shino glazes.</li>
          <li>The development of macroscopic crystals in specially formulated macrocrystalline glazes.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        To summarize what I've gleaned from the sources listed below, all of these effects are due to the formation of crystals in the glaze.
        Slowing down the cooling rate gives crystals more time to grow.
